\description{
A small synthetic dataset for testing climate index functions. It contains daily records from two imaginary weather stations over the years 1981 to 1983.
}
\details{
The dataset includes daily maximum and minimum temperatures, precipitation, and metadata such as year and month for each observation. It is designed for use in unit tests and function examples in this package.

This synthetic dataset is not based on real climate data. It is created solely for testing and development of climate indices and is not intended for scientific analysis.
